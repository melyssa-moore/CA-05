## Overview 
The purpose of this assignment was to predict the Cardiovascular Disease using a Logisitc Regression Model. 

## Operating Instructions 
To run this code properly this ipynb file needs to be uploaded to Google Colab. The data file path can be copied from the .ipynb file as well to run any other models with the data. 

## Package Requirements
